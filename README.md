# UCLA-UGrad
Repository for all my UCLA classes from my undergrad(if I maintain it).
I may also choose to leave out some classes if I didn't like the class, thought the class was irrelevant(or maybe didn't do as well in the class whoops!), but I might just try to include them.

## Motivation
There are two reasons why I am doing this, the personal one and the not-so-personal one. For myself, I would like to keep this repository as a way of looking back, not only at material, but also stuff that was going on in my head, and how i felt about classes and school. Think about it as a kind of public journal. It's kind of a nice substitute for a diary. The other reason is that I think that all my material makes a good resource for others taking classes at UCLA(especially in the ECE department), since in my opinion, the ECE department does not offer as much as the other departments.
