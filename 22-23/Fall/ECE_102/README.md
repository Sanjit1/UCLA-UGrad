# ECE 102

**Instructor**: [Jonathan Kao](https://www.bruinwalk.com/professors/jonathan-c-kao/ec-engr-102/)

**Term**: Fall 2022

**Review**: Pretty good class. I would recommend taking it(with Kao) even if you are not an ECE major. The class is tough, but you WILL walk out of this class with a good understanding of the material. 

## Material and How to succeed
## Lectures:
Lectures can be found in the [`Lectures`](./Lectures/) folder, but it is gitignored because I'm not sure if I am allowed to upload, so if you want the lectures(i think his lectures are good material even if you are taking 102 with Cabric or Kadambi or anyone else) just send me a message.


## Homeworks:
Homeworks can be found in the [`Handouts`](./HandoutsHWs/) folder. My graded solutions can be found in the [`GradedHWs`](./GradedHWs/) folder. If for any reason, you are including problems from the homeworks in public material, please make sure that you cite the TA's.

## Exams:
You know the drill. The exams are in the [`Exams`](./Exams/) folder. These are graded.

## Cheat Sheets:
I wrote my Cheat Sheets in Markdown, and I have them in the root folder. 
[Midterm Cheat Sheet](./Midterm_Cheat_Sheet.md) and 
[Final Cheat Sheet](./Final_Cheat_Sheet.md)

## How to succeed:
Do note that a lot of the content from these cheat sheets are screenshots from office hours. Also if you take this class, you should definitely go to office hours~~more than I did~~. Another tip is if you take it with Kao, you should definitely interact with the staff they are great. Do not miss the review sessions. They are very helpful.
