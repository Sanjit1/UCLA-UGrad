# ECE 102

**Instructor**: [Jonathan Kao](https://www.bruinwalk.com/professors/jonathan-c-kao/ec-engr-102/)

**Term**: Fall 2022

**Review**: Me like

## Lectures:
Lectures can be found in the [`Lectures`](./Lectures/) folder, but it is gitignored, so if you want the lectures just send me a message.


## Homeworks:
Homeworks can be found in the [`Handouts`](./HandoutsHWs/) folder. My graded solutions can be found in the [`GradedHWs`](./GradedHWs/) folder. Do note that the Handouts is gitignored, so if you want the handouts just send me a message and I'll send them to you.

## Exams:
You know the drill. The exams are in the [`Exams`](./Exams/) folder. These are graded.

## Cheat Sheets:
I wrote my Cheat Sheets in Markdown, and I have them in the root folder. 
[Midterm Cheat Sheet](./Midterm_Cheat_Sheet.md) and 
[Final Cheat Sheet](./Final_Cheat_Sheet.md)

Do note that a lot of the content from these cheat sheets are screenshots from office hours. Also if you take this class, you should definitely go to office hours~~more than I did~~. Another tip is if you take it with Kao, you should definitely interact with the staff they are great. Do not miss the review sessions. They are very helpful.
