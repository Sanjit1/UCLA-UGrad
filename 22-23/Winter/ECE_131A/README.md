# ECE 113

**Instructor**: [Lara Dolecek](https://www.bruinwalk.com/professors/lara-dolecek)

**Term**: Winter 2023

**Review**: Fricking amazing. It was a very busy class, many assignments and a very tight schedule. But she was a great lecturer and the class was very well organized, and I learned a lot more than I expected to.

## Material and How to succeed
## Lectures:
Lectures can be found in the [`Lectures`](./Lectures/) folder.

## Homeworks:
Homeworks can be found in the [`Handouts`](./HandoutsHWs/) folder. My graded solutions can be found in the [`GradedHWs`](./GradedHWs/) folder. If for any reason, you are including problems from the homeworks in public material, please make sure that you cite the TA's. The TA solutions are in ['HW Solns'](./HW_Solns/) but are also gitignored.

## Exams:
You know the drill. Exams can be found in the [`Exams`](./Exams/) folder. These are graded. My Cheat Sheets are also in the exams folder. 

## Final Project:
The final project can be found in the [`Final Project`](./Final_Project/) folder. Its quite time consuming, so start it early. It was quite interesting though.

## How to succeed:
Go to discussions, attend lectures and start the project early. The book is also a pretty good reference, so do complete the assigned readings. Do make sure you understand material before moving on, because its very very fast paced.
