# ECE 10

**Instructor**: [Sudhakar Pamarti](https://www.bruinwalk.com/professors/sudhakar-pamarti/)

**Term**: Winter 2023

**Review**: Pamarti is a brilliant lecturer. He explains things very well, but I wish I didn't take it at this point in time. Exams are hard and needed a lot more practice. 


## Material and How to succeed
## Lectures:
Lectures can be found in the [`Lectures`](./Lectures/) folder, but it is gitignored because I'm not sure if I am allowed to upload, so if you want the lectures just send me a message.


## Homeworks:
Homeworks can be found in the [`Handouts`](./HandoutsHWs/) folder. My graded solutions can be found in the [`GradedHWs`](./GradedHWs/) folder. If for any reason, you are including problems from the homeworks in public material, please make sure that you cite the TA's. The TA solutions are in ['HW Solns'](./HW_Solns/) but are also gitignored.


## Exams:
You know the drill. The exams are in the [`Exams`](./Exams/) folder. These are graded. My Cheat Sheets are also in the exams folder.

## How to succeed:
I found that the TA office hours and discussion sections were very helpful. If you take it with Pamarti, you should try to keep a lighter schedule, since the lecture is often late at night:(6-8). Unfortunately, I had a lot of gaps in my schedule, which made it painful to attend lecture, and I wish I had not stopped going to lecture(this is usually my regret for classes).
