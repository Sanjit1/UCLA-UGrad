## Material and How to succeed
## Lectures:
Lectures can be found in the [`Lectures`](./Lectures/) folder.

## Homeworks:
Homeworks can be found in the [`Handouts`](./HandoutsHWs/) folder. My graded solutions can be found in the [`GradedHWs`](./GradedHWs/) folder. If for any reason, you are including problems from the homeworks in public material, please make sure that you cite the TA's. The TA solutions are in ['HW Solns'](./HW_Solns/) but are also gitignored. 

## Exams:
You know the drill. The exams are in their folder. There are also practice exams in those folders.

## Cheat Sheets:
I wrote my Cheat Sheets in Markdown, and I have them in the root folder.

## How to succeed:
Look at old midterms and finals. Do a lot of practice and hope that he does not experiment with the class format, cuz he might.
