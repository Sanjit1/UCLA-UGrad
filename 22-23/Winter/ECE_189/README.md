# ECE 189

**Instructor**: [Achuta Kadambi](https://www.bruinwalk.com/professors/achuta-kadambi/)

**Term**: Winter 2023

**Review**: It was the first time this class was offered, so it was a bit of a mess. The organization was not great, but professor and the TA's were great lecturers. I took this class on a whim and it turned out to be a really good decision.

## Material
Well this is a 189, soooo yea, this is more of a showcase. I will probably make a proper repository for the project, but the report and notebook are in this folder.
