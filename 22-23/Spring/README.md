## Stuff
Last quarter of freshman year! Jeez, time flies. I joined [VMG](http://visual.ee.ucla.edu/), and love it here. Became one of the workshops lead for [IEEE](https://ieeebruins.com/lab). Classes wise, I had kinda checked out, which is why its nice that I had a super easy workload. On the other hand, it sorta sucked that these classes were just mindless work, but oh well.
