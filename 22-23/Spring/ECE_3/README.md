# ECE 3

**Instuctor:** [Dennis Briggs](https://www.bruinwalk.com/professors/dennis-m-briggs/ec-engr-3/)

**Term:** Spring 2023

**Review:** Not for me

## Material and How to succeed
## Lectures:
Nope, I will not put you through these lecture slides. 

## Homeworks:
I forgot to download the handouts(sorry about that!). You can still find the questions in my graded solutions, which can be found in the [`GradedHWs`](./GradedHWs/) folder. If for any reason, you are including problems from the homeworks in public material, please make sure that you cite the TA's.

## Quizzes and Final:
Graded quizzes are in the [`Quizzes`](./Quizzes/) folder. The graded final is in the [`Final`](./Final/) folder. Cheat sheets are allowed for the final but I was too busy(wtf was I even doing lmfao) to make one.

## How to succeed:
You will need to self study a lot and make sure you understand the content, which i do not expect you to understand from lectures. Come hang out with us @ [IEEE](https://ieeebruins.com/lab) and get help(we love helping out!). The quizzes are what distinguish grades, since for the rest the medians are close to 100, so make sure you understand the quiz concepts.

Also don't be a stuck up bitch about fractions and stuff like that, I made this mistake in 3 and 10, and it cost me in 10. You can(in fact should!) approximate expressions to decimals.
