## Material and How to succeed
## Lectures:
He didnt have slides, but I did take notes, till I stopped going to class. Those notes are in the [`Notes`](./Notes/) folder.

## Homeworks:
Unfotch the homeworks were on mastering physics, so I can't put them here, but they weren't too bad(actually I hate the mastering physics UI and questions and the entire stuff).

## Midterms and Final:
Lol, there are 4 midterms. You can find my graded copies in the ['Midterms'](./Midterms/) folder. Don't judge me lol im providing a service here. You can find my graded copy in the ['Final'](./Final/) folder. Final was ~ same difficulty.

## How to succeed:
You will need to self study a lot and make sure you understand the content, which i do not expect you to understand from lectures. Go to IEEE and get help. The quizzes are what distinguish grades, since for the rest the medians are close to 100, so make sure you understand the quiz concepts.
